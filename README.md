# Step-moonlite-astrofocus
A simple focuser program made for use on multiple different microcontrollers and stepper motors drivers with STP/DIR inputs.
It uses a modified version of hansastro's moonlite library: https://github.com/Hansastro/Focuser


## Setup

1. Drop the ```Moonlite```(inside libraries) folder into your ```.\Documents\Arduino\libraries\``` folder.
2. Drop the ```focuser``` folder into your ```.\Documents\Arduino\``` folder and open it using the Arduino IDE.
3. Setup the stp, dir, MS1, MS2 in accordance with your own pinout. The led pin is used as a debug led, you can set it to an unused pin on your microcontroller. If you have more or less microstepping pins, add or remove the pins at the top of the document. Also add or remove the pin setup in the setup() function, as well as the microstepping setting in the ML_SF and ML_SH case statement (in my case I set it to 8th and 16th step for the A4988). In some cases you might also have to set up Enable, Sleep and Reset pins. Again, if your situation differs from mine add or remove the pins from the top of the document and add or remove the pin setup in the setup() function.
(optional) you can set a sleep mode near the bottom of the document, this can be helpfull to reduce heat buildup or to save power. There is an if else statement which checks if a variable called 'allowed' is true. Basically as long as the motor is supposed to run, it will not be sleeping.
4. Upload the sketch by following the upload procedure required for your board.

## To be implemented

- Temperature compensation.

## Troubleshooting

> The motor isn't turning.

Check your wiring, read through the documentation of your stepper motor driver to see if there are any pins that need to be high, low or can be left floating (personally don't reccommend letting it float because something as little as your finger can make it flip to either side). It is also important to check if you are supplying a high enough voltage and don't have the current setting on the driver turned all the way down.
> The motor is just purring and not/barely moving.

The current setting and/or voltage might be too low or too high. You can also try switching the wires on one of the two motor phases around, this can help in case the motor is trying to step against itself. So like one step clockwise and then one step counterclockwise. What might also help is adding a large electrolytic capacitor in parallel with the driver's motor voltage input. Long cables and/or badly designed power supplies can cause problems because these motors can have very high current spikes. There is a chance it won't propperly step if there isn't a capacitor. Get a big one, between 100 and 1000 uF with a voltage rated for what you are using (take a safety margin, at least 3V, but more to be safe).
> The motor/driver is getting quite hot.

Try lowering the current setting. A focuser really doesn't need a whole lot of torque. What might also help is setting up a sleep function. Most drivers have some sort of sleep or enable pin. Do some research and find out if it is the case. In step 3 of the setup it is explained how it can be configured in software.

## Known Issues

- ~~NINA will give an error when you try to move larger steps.~~ (fixed) the microcontroller was always reporting that the motor was stopped, which the driver didn't seem to like.
