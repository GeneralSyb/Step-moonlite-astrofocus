# !EXPERIMENTAL!

I'm still working on the PCB, but here you can find the first version of the 2-layer PCB designed for use with the Seeed studio XIAO RP2040 and A4988 stepper motor driver. It has a barrel plug for power, a spot for a 3-pin 2.54 mm terminal block for a temperature sensor and a 4-pin 2.54 mm terminal block for connections to the stepper motor.

Symbols, footprints and 3D models can be found at:
